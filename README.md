# 01-HTML-GIT-CSS

## Description

The client, Horiseon Marketing Company, wanted codebase that follows accessibility standards so that their site is optimized for search engines.

Additionally, The Horiseon Marketing Company webpage  wanted to include a navigation bar, a header image, and cards with text and images at the bottom of the page.

I learned how to implement semantic elements and when to use discretion for div elements, which are not semantic, but useful for stlying purposes. I also learned how to position conent on the page with CSS.
